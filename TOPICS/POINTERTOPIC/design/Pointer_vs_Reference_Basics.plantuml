title Pointer vs Reference - Core Concepts

package "Pointer Fundamentals" {
  rectangle "Declaration" as P1 {
    card "int* ptr;" as pc1
    note right: Pointer can be null\nCan be reassigned\nNeeds dereferencing
  }
  
  rectangle "Initialization" as P2 {
    card "int x = 10;\nint* ptr = &x;" as pc2
    note right: ptr stores ADDRESS of x\nptr itself is a variable
  }
  
  rectangle "Dereferencing" as P3 {
    card "*ptr = 20;" as pc3
    note right: Access value through *\nCan cause segfault if null
  }
  
  rectangle "Null Pointer" as P4 {
    card "int* ptr = nullptr;" as pc4
    note right: Valid but dangerous\nMust check before use
  }
}

package "Reference Fundamentals" {
  rectangle "Declaration" as R1 {
    card "int& ref = x;" as rc1
    note right: MUST be initialized\nCannot be null\nCannot be reassigned
  }
  
  rectangle "No Dereferencing" as R2 {
    card "ref = 20;" as rc2
    note right: Automatic dereferencing\nCleaner syntax
  }
  
  rectangle "Alias" as R3 {
    card "ref IS x" as rc3
    note right: Same memory location\nJust another name
  }
}

note bottom
  **Key Difference:**
  Pointer = Variable holding address
  Reference = Alias to existing variable
