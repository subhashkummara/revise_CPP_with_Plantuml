title Uninitialized (Garbage) vs Null Pointer - Why Both Crash

    **Unpredictable!**
    • May crash immediately
    • May crash later
    • May corrupt data
    • May "appear to work"
    **Most dangerous!**

  note bottom
    **Predictable!**
    • ALWAYS crashes
    • Crash is immediate
    • Easy to debug
    • Intentional protection
    **Safer to debug!**
