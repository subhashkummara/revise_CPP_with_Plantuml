title Why derived* obj = new Base() Fails

package "What You're Trying To Do" #pink {
  
  card "new Base()" as base {
    **Base Object (16 bytes)**
    ----
    a (private): 4 bytes
    b (private): 4 bytes
    x (public): 4 bytes
    y (public): 4 bytes
  }
  
  card "derived* obj" as ptr {
    **Expects derived Object (32 bytes)**
    ----
    Needs all Base members (16 bytes)
    PLUS derived members (16 bytes)
  }
  
  ptr -down-> base: Points to
  
  note bottom #red
    **ERROR: Invalid conversion!**
    
    Base object is TOO SMALL!
    Only 16 bytes allocated
    
    derived* expects 32 bytes:
    • Base part: a,b,x,y (16 bytes)
    • derived part: c,d,p,q (16 bytes)
    
    If obj->p is called:
    Would access unallocated memory!
    CRASH or garbage data!
  end note
