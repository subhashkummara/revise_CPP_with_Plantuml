title Common Mistakes to Avoid

card Mistake1 [
  **Object Slicing**
  
  Derived d;
  Base b = d;  // WRONG!
  
  Fix:
  Base* b = &d;  // Pointer
  Base& b = d;   // Reference
]

card Mistake2 [
  **Virtual in Constructor**
  
  class Base {
    Base() { virtualFunc(); }
  }
  
  Issue: Calls Base version,
  not Derived version
  
  Fix: Don't call virtual
  in constructors
]

card Mistake3 [
  **Non-virtual Destructor**
  
  class Base {
    ~Base() { }  // WRONG!
  }
  
  Fix:
  virtual ~Base() { }
]
