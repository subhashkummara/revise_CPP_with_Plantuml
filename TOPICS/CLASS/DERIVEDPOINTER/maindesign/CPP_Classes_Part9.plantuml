title Best Practices Summary

card Design [
  **Design:**
  Use inheritance for is-a
  Prefer composition
  Keep hierarchies shallow
  Use interfaces
]

card Virtual [
  **Virtual Functions:**
  Use for polymorphism
  ALWAYS virtual destructor
  Avoid in performance code
  Use final keyword when done
]

card Memory [
  **Memory:**
  Use smart pointers
  unique_ptr for ownership
  shared_ptr for sharing
  Avoid raw new/delete
]

Design -right-> Virtual
Virtual -right-> Memory

note bottom
  Key Points:
  1. Virtual destructor is CRITICAL
  2. Use smart pointers
  3. Prefer composition
  4. dynamic_cast for safe downcast
  5. Construction: Base -> Derived
  6. Destruction: Derived -> Base
