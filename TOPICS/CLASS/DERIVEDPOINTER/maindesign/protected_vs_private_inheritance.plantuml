title Protected vs Private Inheritance - The Subtle Difference

  class Base {
    - int privateData
    # int protectedData
    + int publicData
  }
  
  class ProtectedDerived {
    **Protected Inheritance**
    --
    Base::protectedData → protected
    Base::publicData → protected
    --
    Can be inherited FURTHER
    by GrandChild
  }
  
  class PrivateDerived {
    **Private Inheritance**
    --
    Base::protectedData → private
    Base::publicData → private
    --
    STOPS here!
    GrandChild cannot inherit
  }
  
  class GrandChildProtected {
    **Can access:**
    protectedData (inherited)
    publicData (inherited)
    --
    Inheritance chain continues
  }
  
  class GrandChildPrivate {
    **Cannot access:**
    Nothing from Base!
    --
    Inheritance chain BROKEN
  }
  
  Base <|-- ProtectedDerived : protected
  Base <|-- PrivateDerived : private
  
  ProtectedDerived <|-- GrandChildProtected
  PrivateDerived <|-- GrandChildPrivate
  
  note right of ProtectedDerived
    **Protected Inheritance:**
    Base members become protected
    
    Effect: GrandChild CAN
    inherit them further
  end note
  
  note right of PrivateDerived
    **Private Inheritance:**
    Base members become private
    
    Effect: GrandChild CANNOT
    access them (chain broken)
  end note
