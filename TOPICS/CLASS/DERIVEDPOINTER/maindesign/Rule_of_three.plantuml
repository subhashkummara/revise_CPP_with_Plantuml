title Rule of Three/Five/Zero

package "Rule of Three (C++98)" #lightblue {
  component rule3 [
    If you define ONE of these:
    1. Destructor
    2. Copy Constructor
    3. Copy Assignment Operator
    
    You should define ALL THREE
  ]
  
  note right of rule3
    Why:
    If you manage resources
    you need all three to
    manage them correctly
  end note
}

package "Rule of Five (C++11)" #lightgreen {
  component rule5 [
    Add two more:
    4. Move Constructor
    5. Move Assignment Operator
    
    Total: Define all FIVE
  ]
  
  note right of rule5
    Modern C++:
    Enables move semantics
    for better performance
  end note
}

package "Rule of Zero (Preferred)" #lightyellow {
  component rule0 [
    Best Practice:
    Don't manage resources manually
    
    Use:
    - unique_ptr
    - shared_ptr
    - vector
    - string
    
    Let them handle it!
  ]
  
  note right of rule0
    Preferred approach:
    No manual new/delete
    Compiler generates
    correct copy/move
    automatically
  end note
}
