card "Code" as code {
  **Base *obj = new derived();**
  obj->methodA();
}

package "What Happens" {
  card "1. Memory Allocation" as mem {
    • Allocate 32 bytes on heap
    • Address: 0x5000
    • Type: derived object
  }
  
  card "2. Construction" as cons {
    • Base part initialized first
    • derived part initialized second
    • All members set to 0
  }
  
  card "3. Pointer Assignment" as ptr {
    • obj (Base*) = 0x5000
    • Points to derived object
    • Can only access Base part
  }
  
  card "4. Method Call" as method {
    • obj->methodA() works ✅
    • Calls Base::methodA()
    • Prints message
  }
  
  card "5. Memory Leak" as leak {
    • obj never deleted ❌
    • 32 bytes leaked
    • Should call delete obj
  }
}
